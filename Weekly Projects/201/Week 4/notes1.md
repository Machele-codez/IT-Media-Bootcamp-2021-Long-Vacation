# Week 1 Project - Abu's Coffee Shop

This project is the first for the 201 class. Just to help them get familiar with basic HTML tags.

Here the tags/concepts treated are:

- heading, p, em, strong, sup, img, a, u
- centering text and elements using align attribute and center tag.
- creating page divisions using hr tags, making them more elegant with the width attribute

Notes to Students

- All images have a width of 300 no height explicitly given.
